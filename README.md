# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
With the use of our tools, we are be able to analyze the rideshare data of PyBer. The resulting dataframe will be used to create visualizations, in which show how each city fares.

## Result
In our analysis, we can determine a few differences among the cities.  With the use of our dataframe, we see that urban cities outperform the other two. Rural areas have the least rides, however seem to cost more.  This is because of its location compared to the other two cities.

While the demand in the rural areas are not so high, there can be a potential in the suburban areas. Both of these areas are underserved, urban areas will always have rides.  However a bit more focus in these cities may help with more revenue.

In our graph, we can sense that certain times of the year will also generate money.  However without enough drivers, maximizing revenue and fees are not happening.  There are just not enough drivers in the suburban and rural areas.

## Summary

To Conclude

  -Having a consistent fleet of drivers in urban areas should always generate money.
  
  -The end of winter and beginning of spring seasons, generate money for all cities.  More drivers should be available for this time of the year.
  
  -If more drivers are allocated to rural and suburban areas, average fare may lower, however more potential in revenue in these cities can occur.
